NOTE:
Every level must have a Player object and a Door object, or else null pointer exception. Because reference to Player and Door are used for specific actions/IO.
	Maybe we could make our own InvalidLevelException and throw it if there's no Player or Door?


BUG: PinEntity has no default constructor PinEntity(GameWorld world). 
	Cannot use in LevelEditor without it.

TODO: Give PhysicsEntity a _density so that Mass is defined by area and density

TODO: Make sensors on every level that call a Player input doDie
TODO: Make Boulder a Polygon and cap its rotational velocity
TODO: resolution proportional to length
TODO: Show stars and open/closed levels on LevelMenu
	Make a level win or lose screen
TODO: Optimize time step
TODO: Boulder and other objects affected by world
TODO: Save/Load levels
TODO: Sprites and pretty graphics
	Use online. Mina's too busy

BUG: AARectShape's location is getting set at center. 
	But World reads level editor's box as a PolygonShape (rectToPoly), so just don't use AARectShape


TODO: Optimization!
	Make closestPointOnCurve faster!!
	TRY?: Using RootBisection to find roots of equation for closestPointOnCurve. Just turn that dot product into a class that implements the Function class, with a method f that returns f(x) at a specified x. Then RootBisection should find roots using midpoint iterations. Returns root within a given interval (specified as a Bracket object)

BUG: walls don't work both ways for Polygons only.
