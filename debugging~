BUG: YOU FALL THROUGH LOWER CURVE, only lower curve. DOTS IN UPPER CURVE, only upper curve

ASK TA:
	Tridiagonal class? ask TA
	Player disappears from curve after a bit (possibly has to do with time step?)

BUG: Jiggly Viewport rotation
BUG: Weird speed up/slow down when holding dir

TODO: Boulder and other objects affected by world.
TODO: Relay entity that lets you open door after one star
	Door gray until star picked up, then turns yellow/green or whatever color
TODO: Show stars and open/closed levels on LevelMenu
TODO: Keep track of stars for each level
TODO: Save/Load levels
TODO: Fill in closed curves
	Commented out g.fill code in BezierPath


TODO: Optimization!
	Make closestPointOnCurve faster!!
	TRY?: Using RootBisection to find roots of equation for closestPointOnCurve. Just turn that dot product into a class that implements the Function class, with a method f that returns f(x) at a specified x. Then RootBisection should find roots using midpoint iterations. Returns root within a given interval (specified as a Bracket object)

BUG: Collisions only getting called in one direction, if you extend functionality of collides (i.e. Player for jumping) it might never actually get called. Could change PhysicsEntity so it's not calling other.getShape().collides but rather calling other.collides().
	- Buuuut for now we can just make sure the Player is added to beginning of list...
