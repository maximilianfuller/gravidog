FINAL2 README

TOTAL AGGREGATE HOURS: 
40

KNOWN BUGS:
curve collision (for level 3 especially) can be buggy. Sometimes the player enters the shape.

REQUIREMENTS:

Gravity changes depending on what surface the player is currently touching.

The viewport pans and rotates with the player and the player's gravity.

We have two levels implemented. A third level (level_two) may be available by playtesting.

ALSO OF NOTE: We use an external library that solves cyclic matrices (pj2.lib.edu.rit). All we use is a single method from one class[Tridiagonal] in the library.
