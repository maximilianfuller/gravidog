Parallel Java 2 (PJ2) is
an API and middleware for parallel programming in 100% Java
on shared memory multiprocessor (SMP) parallel computers,
cluster parallel computers,
and hybrid SMP cluster parallel computers.
PJ2 was developed by Professor Alan Kaminsky
in the Department of Computer Science
at the Rochester Institute of Technology.

<P>
I am happy to answer general questions about the Parallel Java 2 Library,
receive bug reports,
and entertain requests for additional features.
Please contact me by email at

I regret that I am unable to provide technical support,
specific installation instructions for your system,
or advice about configuring your parallel computer hardware.

<A NAME="requirements"><H2>System Requirements</H2></A>

<P>
PJ2 was developed using
Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.7.
When compiling and running PJ2 programs,
you must use JDK 1.7.
PJ2 uses features of the Java language and platform
introduced in JDK 1.7
and will not compile with earlier JDK versions.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="installation"><H2>Installation</H2></A>

<P>
There are two versions of the PJ2 distribution,
an executable distribution
and a source distribution.

<P>
<B>Executable distribution.</B>
The executable distribution comes in a Java Archive (JAR) file
named <TT>"pj2_<I>YYYYMMDD</I>.jar"</TT>,
where <I>YYYYMMDD</I> are the year, month, and date.
The executable distribution includes the PJ2 class files only.
To install the executable distribution,
simply store the JAR file somewhere.
You may wish to change the file name,
say to <TT>"pj2.jar"</TT>.

<P>
<B>Source distribution.</B>
The source distribution comes in a Java Archive (JAR) file
named <TT>"pj2src_<I>YYYYMMDD</I>.jar"</TT>,
where <I>YYYYMMDD</I> are the year, month, and date.
The source distribution includes the PJ2 class files,
source files, and documentation files (Javadoc).
To install the source distribution,
just unpack the JAR file.
The source distribution expands into a subdirectory
named <TT>"pj2"</TT>.
If you already have a subdirectory of that name
which you want to save,
be sure to unpack the JAR file
in some other directory.
Documentation is stored under the directory
<TT>"pj2/doc"</TT>;
point your HTML browser to that directory.
Java source files and class files
are stored under the directory
<TT>"pj2/lib"</TT>.

<P>
<B>Installation on a SMP computer.</B>
To run PJ2 programs on a shared memory multiprocessor (SMP) parallel computer,
no further installation is required.

<P>
<B>Installation on a cluster.</B>
To run PJ2 programs on a cluster parallel computer,
on a computing grid, or in the cloud,
in addition to installing the PJ2 JAR file,
you must configure and run certain daemon processes
on the frontend and backend processors of the cluster.
For further information, see package
<A HREF="edu/rit/pj2/tracker/package-summary.html">edu.rit.pj2.tracker</A>.

<P>
<HR>
<A NAME="usage"><H2>Usage</H2></A>

<P>
<B>Executable distribution.</B>
When compiling and executing Java programs
that use PJ2,
if you have installed the executable distribution,
you must set your classpath
to include the PJ2 JAR file.
Here is an example of a command for the <TT>bash</TT> shell
to set the classpath to the current directory
plus the PJ2 JAR file:

<P>
<TT>export&nbsp;CLASSPATH=.:/home/fac/ark/public_html/pj2.jar</TT>

<P>
Here is an example of a command for the <TT>csh</TT> shell
to set the classpath to the current directory
plus the PJ2 JAR file:

<P>
<TT>setenv&nbsp;CLASSPATH&nbsp;.:/home/fac/ark/public_html/pj2.jar</TT>

<P>
<B>Source distribution.</B>
When compiling and executing Java programs
that use PJ2,
if you have installed the source distribution,
you must set your classpath
to include the top-level directory
under which PJ2's Java class files are stored.
Here is an example of a command for the <TT>bash</TT> shell
to set the classpath to the current directory
plus the PJ2 directory:

<P>
<TT>export&nbsp;CLASSPATH=.:/home/fac/ark/public_html/pj2/lib</TT>

<P>
Here is an example of a command for the <TT>csh</TT> shell
to set the classpath to the current directory
plus the PJ2 directory:

<P>
<TT>setenv&nbsp;CLASSPATH&nbsp;.:/home/fac/ark/public_html/pj2/lib</TT>

<DL COMPACT>

<P><DT>21-Nov-2013
<DD>
In package edu.rit.pjmr:
Changed the reducer task
to optionally sort the (key, value) pairs
before reducing them;
this is specified by the <TT>comesBefore()</TT> method
of class Customizer.
Changed the example PJMR map-reduce programs
in package edu.rit.pjmr.example
to use the new capability.

<P><DT>20-Nov-2013
<DD>
Fixed several bugs in package edu.rit.pjmr.
Added more example PJMR map-reduce programs
in package edu.rit.pjmr.example.

<P><DT>19-Nov-2013
<DD>
Added the Parallel Java Map Reduce Framework (PJMR),
a simple parallel map-reduce framework
built on top of Parallel Java 2,
in package edu.rit.pjmr.
Added example PJMR map-reduce programs
in package edu.rit.pjmr.example.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj2:
The parallel for loop body classes were refactored.
Class Loop is the body for an integer parallel for loop;
class LongLoop is the body for a long integer parallel for loop;
class ObjectLoop is the body for an iterator parallel for loop;
these all extend a common LoopBody base class.
This change improves the compile time type safety
of the loop body classes
and eliminates a bug
where the iterator parallel for loop body's <TT>run()</TT> method
could not be overridden properly.
However,
this requires changing programs
with long integer parallel for loops
to use class LongLoop instead of class Loop,
and changing programs
with iterator parallel for loops
to use class ObjectLoop instead of class Loop.
Also,
made the <TT>threadLocal()</TT> method a generic method;
this eliminates the need to downcast the return value.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj2:
Changed all the shared variable classes
to extend class Tuple
and to define the <TT>toString()</TT> method.
Added class StringVbl.
Added the <TT>parallelDo(int,Section)</TT> method
to class Task;
this executes a number of copies of the same section in parallel.
<P>
In package edu.rit.io:
Added class SerializedObject.
In package edu.rit.pj2.tracker:
Changed the backend, job, launcher, and tracker sender and receiver classes
to use DataInputStream and DataOutputStream with class SerializedObject,
rather than ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream.
This fixed an intermittent bug
where an end-of-file was encountered
in the middle of a message.
However,
the message format is now incompatible
with earlier versions of the Library.

<P><DT>29-Oct-2013
<DD>
Fixed a bug in class edu.rit.pj2.tracker.JobSender;
the methods were not all properly synchronized.

<P><DT>24-Oct-2013
<DD>
Fixed a bug in class edu.rit.pj2.TupleSpace;
removal of tuples did not work properly
if the same tuple object was put into tuple space multiple times
(which is allowed).
Thank you to Pankaj Deshmukh for discovering the bug.

<P><DT>06-Oct-2013
<DD>
In the <TT>pj2</TT> program,
added the <TT>timelimit</TT> parameter.
In class edu.rit.pj2.Job,
added the <TT>timeLimit()</TT> method.

<P><DT>05-Oct-2013
<DD>
In class edu.rit.pj2.Debug:
Added the <TT>makespan</TT> debug printout.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj2.example:
Changed class PiClu to a hybrid parallel program.
Added classes BCAClu, BCASmp, and TotientClu.
<P>
In class edu.rit.pj2.Tracker:
Added the time each job has spent waiting or running
on the Tracker's web interface summary page.

<P><DT>19-Sep-2013
<DD>
In class edu.rit.pj2.Loop:
Made the <TT>threadLocal()</TT> method a generic method;
this eliminates the need to downcast the return value.
Thank you to Matthew Fluet for suggesting this change.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj2.example:
Added class MineCoinClu3.

<P><DT>13-Sep-2013
<DD>
In class edu.rit.pj2.Task:
Changed the names of the methods that take tuples out of tuple space;
they are now called <TT>takeTuple()</TT> and <TT>tryToTakeTuple()</TT>.
Added methods that read tuples without taking them out of tuple space;
they are called <TT>readTuple()</TT> and <TT>tryToReadTuple()</TT>.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj2:
Changed class Vbl to an interface.
Eliminated class ObjectVbl;
to do parallel reduction on an object,
write a class that implements interface Vbl.
This change eliminates a layer of indirection
and simplifies programs involving parallel reduction on objects.

<P><DT>02-Sep-2013
<DD>
In package edu.rit.pj2:
Fixed a bug in class Job;
tuple take requests were not processed properly
in all cases.
Fixed a bug in class Tuple;
a null field was not printed properly.

<P><DT>30-Aug-2013
<DD>
In package edu.rit.pj2:
In class Task:
Added the non-blocking <TT>tryToGetTuple()</TT> method.
<P>
In package edu.rit.util:
In class Packing:
Added methods to pack and unpack
short integers to integers,
short integers to long integers,
and integers to long integers.

<P><DT>12-Aug-2013
<DD>
In class edu.rit.draw.item.Arrow:
Added the ability to specify the arrow width.
<P>
In package edu.rit.crypto:
Added classes/interfaces CipherInputStream, CipherOutputStream,
RC4, and StreamCipher.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj2:
In class Job:
Fixed a bug;
printouts on the standard output or standard error
from tasks in other nodes
were not synchronized properly.
In class Task:
Changed the <TT>putTuple(int,Tuple)</TT> method;
the number of copies is now the first argument.
<P>
In package edu.rit.swing:
Added a "PNG Setup" dialog to class DisplayableFrame
that lets the user specify scale factor and resolution
when saving a PNG file.
As a consequence,
the View program (in the unnamed package)
now writes PNG files
with a user-selectable scale factor and resolution.

<P><DT>19-Jul-2013
<DD>
In package edu.rit.util:
Added classes/interfaces
LongAction,
LongActionResult,
LongList,
and LongPredicate.
<P>
In package edu.rit.image:
Added the ability
to specify the physical pixel dimensions
in the PNG image writer classes.
<P>
In class edu.rit.swing.DisplayableIO:
Added the ability
to specify the physical pixel dimensions
in the PNG image writing methods.
As a consequence,
the View program (in the unnamed package)
now writes PNG files
at a resolution of 300&times;300 pixels per inch.
<P>
Added package edu.rit.crypto
with classes/interfaces
HashFunction
and SHA256.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj2:
Added class TerminateException.
Code in a job or task must not call <TT>System.exit()</TT>;
rather, it should throw a TerminateException
or another runtime exception
to terminate the program.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj2.example:
Changed the Totient programs to use class LongList.
Changed the MineCoin programs to use class SHA256.
Changed all the programs to exit by throwing an IllegalArgumentException
if the command line arguments are bad.
<P>
In package edu.rit.pj2.tracker:
Changed class Launcher;
the command that launches the JVM
can now include arguments after the command name.

<P><DT>12-Jul-2013
<DD>
The initial version of PJ2 was released.
This version supports tightly coupled multicore parallel programming
(class <A HREF="edu/rit/pj2/Task.html">edu.rit.pj2.Task</A>)
and loosely coupled cluster parallel programming
(class <A HREF="edu/rit/pj2/Job.html">edu.rit.pj2.Job</A>).
