M2 INSTRUCTIONS

The player which you control is the yellow circle. Control the movement of the player using the arrow keys -- press 'up' to jump (or 'down' to bounce). The player may jump if and only if it is stable on top of a solid object (not bouncing or in mid-air).

Press space bar to shoot a lazor pulse in the direction of the mouse cursor. The lazor visualizion will show you where your bullet has been shot. If you shoot other entities, it will apply an impulse to them. 

Press ctrl to throw a grenade in the direction of your mouse cursor. The grenade has a limited blast radius, and does not affect the Player as much as the other shapes. It will explode on contact with a solid surface, and apply an impulse to all entities within its radius.

Collisions with the pink square are very elastic, and collisions with the blue circle are very inelastic. The circle is the heaviest object, heavier than the player. The polygon is lightest object, and both the polygon and square are lighter than player. 

You can create any of the three shapes using the controls described above. 
Click Left (lower mass square), Shift+Left (lower mass polygon), or Shift+Right (greater mass circle)

'Left Click' -- Create square with less mass than player (at current mouse location)
	'+ Shift' -- Polygon with less mass than player
'Right Click' -- Remove object that is clicked on, if any
	'+ Shift' -- Circle with greater mass than player
 Arrow Keys -- Control movement of player (the yellow circle)
'r' -- restart (return to Main Menu)
'q' -- quit
