NOTE:
Every level must have a Player object and a Door object, or else null pointer exception. Because
reference to Player and Door are used for specific actions and IO.
	Maybe we could make our own InvalidLevelException and throw it if there's no Player or Door?


BUG: Jiggly Viewport rotation
	//find polynomial solver or root finder in library...

BUG: STILL? Player disappears from curve after a bit (possibly has to do with time step?)
	And Boulders disappear when they're both on the curve! (see Level 2)

BUG: PinEntity has no default constructor PinEntity(GameWorld world). 
	Cannot use in LevelEditor without it.

BUG: AARectShape's location is getting set at center. 
	But World reads level editor's box as a PolygonShape (rectToPoly), so just don't use AARectShape


TODO: Optimization!
	Make closestPointOnCurve faster!!
	TRY?: Using RootBisection to find roots of equation for closestPointOnCurve. Just turn that dot product into a class that implements the Function class, with a method f that returns f(x) at a specified x. Then RootBisection should find roots using midpoint iterations. Returns root within a given interval (specified as a Bracket object)

BUG: walls don't work both ways for Polygons only.
