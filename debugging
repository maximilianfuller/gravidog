BUG: Fix zoom
BUG: Curve collision only works in one direction
	- Fix or find workaround

BUG: Collisions only getting called in one direction, if you extend functionality of collides (i.e. Player for jumping) it might never actually get called. Could change PhysicsEntity so it's not calling other.getShape().collides but rather calling other.collides().
	- Buuuut for now we can just make sure the Player is added to beginning of list...

TODO: Add accumulatedTime to fixed timestep in GameWorld
TODO: delete AAB
	TODO: Squares to polygons
TODO: Pan screen to follow player (use Max's engine algorithm; right now just keeps in same pos relative to screen)

TODO (if we want):
- Create _rotatable boolean
- Jumping on slanted surfaces
- Jumping at right moment on bounce; not only after being totally settled
- Make level editor more extensible! Move most of it to engine (GameWorld)
- Fix entity mass to area? Or just make a density var?
	(use static PolygonShape.getArea method)

Bezier Curve Aspirations
- Optimize collision detection!
	- Solve equation of circle-curve collision, optimize
- Quadratic Bezier Curves (will be eaiser)
- Recursively check collision until translated out?
- Create curve through three points (or more points)
- Poly-Bezier curves: Combining cubic and quadratic into higher degree
- Optimize drawing and collision detection
	- Bounding boxes
- Call collision detection recursively until translated out?
