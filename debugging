BUG: Jiggly Viewport rotation
	//find polynomial solver or root finder in library...

BUG: STILL? Player disappears from curve after a bit (possibly has to do with time step?)

TODO: resolution proportional to length

TODO: Optimization!
	Make closestPointOnCurve faster!!
	TRY?: Using RootBisection to find roots of equation for closestPointOnCurve. Just turn that dot product into a class that implements the Function class, with a method f that returns f(x) at a specified x. Then RootBisection should find roots using midpoint iterations. Returns root within a given interval (specified as a Bracket object)

BUG: walls don't work both ways for Polygons only.
