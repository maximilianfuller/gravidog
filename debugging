BUG: For entities with CircleShapes, you have to set the restitution too damn high
BUG: When player goes too fast, you can't change direction with goal velocity
BUG: POI error; talk to TA
	Find a way to calculate the POI when no vertices are contained in other shape
BUG: Fix zoom
BUG: If the ball just sits on a curve for a really long time, it eventually suddenly falls through...

TODO: Squares to polygons
TODO: Pan screen to follow player (use Max's engine algorithm; right now just keeps in same pos relative to screen)
TODO (if we want):
- Create _rotatable boolean
- Jumping on slanted surfaces
- Jumping at right moment on bounce; not only after being totally settled
- Make level editor more extensible; move most of it to engine (GameWorld)
- Fix mass to area? Or just make a density var?
	(use static PolygonShape.getArea method)

Bezier Curve Aspirations
- Quadratic Bezier Curves
- Poly-Bezier curves: Combining cubic and quadratic into higher degree
- Bounding boxes
- Create curve through three points
