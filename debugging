ASK TA:
	Tridiagonal class? ask TA
	Player disappears from curve after a bit (possibly has to do with time step?)

BUG: YOU FALL THROUGH LOWER CURVE
BUG: Weird speed up/slow down when holding dir

TODO: Save/Load levels
TODO: Fill in shape
TODO: _isGravitational boolean in PhysicsEntity
TODO: Create door and stars
TODO: Smooth rotation

TODO: Optimization!
	Make closestPointOnCurve faster!!
	TRY?: Using RootBisection to find roots of equation for closestPointOnCurve. Just turn that dot product into a class that implements the Function class, with a method f that returns f(x) at a specified x. Then RootBisection should find roots using midpoint iterations. Returns root within a given interval (specified as a Bracket object)

BUG: Collisions only getting called in one direction, if you extend functionality of collides (i.e. Player for jumping) it might never actually get called. Could change PhysicsEntity so it's not calling other.getShape().collides but rather calling other.collides().
	- Buuuut for now we can just make sure the Player is added to beginning of list...
