NOTE:
Every level must have a Player object and a Door object, or else null pointer exception. Because reference to Player and Door are used for specific actions/IO.
	Maybe we could make our own InvalidLevelException and throw it if there's no Player or Door?

BUG: AARectShape's location is getting set at center.
